# Camera Scanner Application

This application is designed to search for and analyze camera systems across networks. It provides functionality to scan IP ranges and integrate with search engines like Shodan, ZoomEye, and Censys.

## Features

- Network scanning for camera discovery
- Multiple scan types: IP, range, search engine queries
- Geographic filtering
- Vulnerability assessment
- Real-time progress tracking
- Proxy support

## Implementation Notes

This application is currently implemented as a demonstration with simulated scanning functionality. In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Implement actual scanning capabilities via a backend service
2. Integrate with real search engine APIs (Shodan, ZoomEye, Censys)
3. Set up appropriate authentication and rate limiting
4. Ensure compliance with legal and ethical requirements for scanning

## Usage

Configure scan settings through the UI and use the provided tools to discover and analyze camera systems across networks.
